                <p>Hello! My name is Cecilia and since childhood, I have been in contact with various forms of artistic
                    expression. Living in different countries has enriched me in many ways. Today, I am in Spain (the
                    land of my grandparents) creating my own line of ceramics, full of color, to
                    brighten your day to day.</p>
